# @tanstack/ai-grok

## 0.8.6

### Patch Changes

- Adopt `@tanstack/eslint-config@0.4.0` and clean up the local override layer. ([#607](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/607))
  - Bump `@tanstack/eslint-config` from `0.3.3` to `0.4.0`.
  - Drop dead `pnpm/enforce-catalog` and `pnpm/json-enforce-catalog` disables (upstream removed `eslint-plugin-pnpm` in `0.3.1`).
  - Drop the `no-case-declarations: off` override — no current source actually violates it.
  - Drop the `no-shadow: off` override — upstream sets it to `warn`, so it surfaces in editors without blocking CI.
  - Remove ~25 unnecessary type assertions across the publishable packages that the upgraded `typescript-eslint` now catches via `no-unnecessary-type-assertion`. One deliberately defensive cast in `ag-ui-wire.ts` is preserved with an inline opt-out and a reason comment.

  No public-API or runtime-behavior changes.

- Update model metadata from OpenRouter API ([#594](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/594))

## 0.8.5

### Patch Changes

- Tighten TypeScript safety: enable `noImplicitOverride`, ([#579](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/579))
  `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, and `useDefineForClassFields` in the
  root `tsconfig.json`; add a typed-ESLint block scoped to
  `packages/typescript/*/src/**` that turns on `no-floating-promises`,
  `no-misused-promises`, `await-thenable`,
  `switch-exhaustiveness-check`, `consistent-type-exports`,
  `prefer-readonly`, and `no-non-null-assertion` (errors), plus
  `no-explicit-any` (warning). `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck` are
  disallowed in library source via `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`,
  and `as unknown as <T>` double-casts are blocked by a
  `no-restricted-syntax` rule (escape hatches available with an inline
  reason). Two flags from the original five-flag set —
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
  — were tried and rolled back: they produced ~500 lines of bracket-
  access and conditional-spread churn without catching any real bugs,
  and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` would have forced consumers using
  it themselves to deal with our internals' style preferences.

  User-visible API surface is unchanged; this is a hardening pass to
  keep streaming/agent-loop correctness and discriminated-union
  exhaustiveness honest going forward. See issue #564.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Streaming structured output across the OpenAI-compatible providers, an OpenAI Chat Completions sibling adapter, a summarize-subsystem unification, and the decoupling of `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` from the shared OpenAI base. ([#527](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/527))

  ## Core — `@tanstack/ai`
  - New `chat({ outputSchema, stream: true })` overload returning `StructuredOutputStream<InferSchemaType<TSchema>>`. The stream yields raw JSON deltas via `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` plus a terminal `CUSTOM` `structured-output.complete` event whose `value.object` is typed against the caller's schema with no helper or cast required.
  - `StructuredOutputStream<T>` is a discriminated union over three tagged `CUSTOM` variants — `structured-output.complete<T>`, `approval-requested`, and `tool-input-available` (new `ApprovalRequestedEvent` / `ToolInputAvailableEvent` interfaces exported from `@tanstack/ai`). Narrowing on `chunk.type === 'CUSTOM' && chunk.name === '<literal>'` resolves `chunk.value` to the exact shape per variant. The bare `CustomEvent` (with `value: any`) is deliberately excluded to keep the narrow from collapsing to `any`; user-emitted events via the `emitCustomEvent` context API still flow at runtime and are documented as a small residual gap.
  - Activity-layer hardening: always-finalise after the stream loop (no silent hangs on missing `finishReason`), typed `RUN_ERROR` on empty content, mid-stream provider errors terminate cleanly, schema-validation failures carry `runId / model / timestamp`.
  - `fallbackStructuredOutputStream` in the activity layer is the single source of truth for adapters that don't implement `structuredOutputStream` natively; `BaseTextAdapter` no longer ships a default.
  - `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter.summarizeStream` accumulates summary text and emits a terminal `CUSTOM` `generation:result` event before the final `RUN_FINISHED`. Fixes `useSummarize` never populating `result` over streaming connections (the client only sets `result` on that specific CUSTOM event).
  - `SummarizationOptions` is now generic in `TProviderOptions` and `modelOptions` is plumbed through end-to-end (previously silently dropped by `runSummarize` / `runStreamingSummarize`).

  ## Framework hooks — `@tanstack/ai-react`, `@tanstack/ai-vue`, `@tanstack/ai-solid`, `@tanstack/ai-svelte`

  `useChat` (React/Vue/Solid) and `createChat` (Svelte) now accept an `outputSchema` option mirroring `chat({ outputSchema })` on the server. When supplied, the hook's return adds two managed reactive fields:
  - `partial` — the live progressive object, typed `DeepPartial<InferSchemaType<typeof outputSchema>>`. Updated from `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas via `parsePartialJSON`. Resets on every new run.
  - `final` — the validated terminal payload from the `structured-output.complete` event, typed `InferSchemaType<typeof outputSchema> | null`. `null` until the run completes.

  Both fields are typed against the schema with no helper or cast — each hook is generic on `TSchema` and conditionally adds the fields to the return type. Without `outputSchema`, the return type is unchanged. Works the same for streaming and non-streaming endpoints — for non-streaming, `partial` stays `{}` and `final` snaps when the single terminal event arrives. Reasoning text and tool calls aren't surfaced as separate hook fields — they're already on `messages[…].parts` (as `ThinkingPart`, `ToolCallPart`, `ToolResultPart`), same as a normal chat. When `outputSchema` is set, the assistant's `TextPart` contains the raw JSON the model produced; filter `text` parts out of your message renderer and let the structured view (driven by `partial` / `final`) replace it.

  Reactivity primitive per framework:

  | Framework                      | `partial` type                                          | `final` type                                     |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | React (`@tanstack/ai-react`)   | `DeepPartial<T>` (plain state)                          | `T \| null` (plain state)                        |
  | Vue (`@tanstack/ai-vue`)       | `Readonly<ShallowRef<DeepPartial<T>>>`                  | `Readonly<ShallowRef<T \| null>>`                |
  | Solid (`@tanstack/ai-solid`)   | `Accessor<DeepPartial<T>>`                              | `Accessor<T \| null>`                            |
  | Svelte (`@tanstack/ai-svelte`) | `readonly partial: DeepPartial<T>` (rune-backed getter) | `readonly final: T \| null` (rune-backed getter) |

  `DeepPartial<T>` is exported from each framework package for callers who want to annotate handlers explicitly.

  ## Base — `@tanstack/openai-base`
  - Package renamed from `@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible` (which remains published for pinned lockfiles but receives no further updates). Imports change:

    ```diff
    - import { OpenAICompatibleChatCompletionsTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible'
    + import { OpenAIBaseChatCompletionsTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/openai-base'
    - import { OpenAICompatibleResponsesTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/ai-openai-compatible'
    + import { OpenAIBaseResponsesTextAdapter } from '@tanstack/openai-base'
    ```

  - Centralised `structuredOutputStream` on both bases. Chat Completions uses `response_format: { type: 'json_schema', strict: true }` + `stream: true`; Responses uses `text.format: { type: 'json_schema', strict: true }` + `stream: true`. Subclasses (`ai-openai`, `ai-grok`, `ai-groq`) inherit it; OpenRouter implements its own (see below).
  - Base now adopts the `openai` SDK directly and imports types from `openai/resources/...`. The previously-vendored ~720 LOC of wire-format types (`ChatCompletion`, `ResponseStreamEvent`, etc.) is removed; consumers that imported wire types from the package should import them from the openai SDK instead. The abstract `callChatCompletion*` / `callResponse*` hooks are gone — the base constructor now takes a pre-built `OpenAI` client (`new OpenAIBaseChatCompletionsTextAdapter(model, name, openaiClient)`) and calls `client.chat.completions.create` / `client.responses.create` itself.
  - New protected `isAbortError(error)` hook duck-types abort detection so `RUN_ERROR { code: 'aborted' }` is emitted consistently across SDK error types — subclasses with proprietary error classes (e.g. `@openrouter/sdk`'s `RequestAbortedError`) override.
  - Per-chunk `logger.provider(...)` debug logging now fires inside `structuredOutputStream` loops, matching the existing pattern in `chatStream` for end-to-end introspection in debug mode.

  The other extension hooks (`extractReasoning`, `extractTextFromResponse`, `processStreamChunks`, `makeStructuredOutputCompatible`, `transformStructuredOutput`, `mapOptionsToRequest`, `convertMessage`) remain. Groq's `processStreamChunks` and `makeStructuredOutputCompatible` overrides (for `x_groq.usage` promotion and Groq's structured-output schema quirks) are unchanged.

  ## Provider adapters

  | Adapter                                                    | API              | Reasoning surface                                                                                                |
  | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openai` `openaiText`                         | Responses        | `response.reasoning_text.delta` + `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` (requires `reasoning.summary: 'auto'`) |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openai` `openaiChatCompletions` (new)        | Chat Completions | reasoning emitted silently — Chat Completions has no `reasoning.summary` opt-in                                  |
  | `@tanstack/ai-grok` `grokText`                             | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoning_content` (DeepSeek convention; not typed by OpenAI SDK)                                         |
  | `@tanstack/ai-groq` `groqText`                             | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoning` (requires `reasoning_format: 'parsed'`; not typed by groq-sdk)                                 |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` `openRouterText`                 | Chat Completions | `delta.reasoningDetails` (camelCase)                                                                             |
  | `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` `openRouterResponsesText` (beta) | Responses (beta) | `response.reasoning_text.delta` + `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta` via `normalizeStreamEvent`             |

  All six emit the contractual `REASONING_*` lifecycle (`REASONING_START` → `REASONING_MESSAGE_START` → `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas → `REASONING_MESSAGE_END` → `REASONING_END`) and close it before `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`. Accumulated reasoning is also surfaced on `structured-output.complete.value.reasoning` for consumers that only subscribe to the terminal event. OpenRouter SDK's proprietary `RequestAbortedError` is mapped (alongside DOM `AbortError`) to `code: 'aborted'` in the two openrouter adapters.

  `@tanstack/ai-openai` also exports a new `OpenAIChatCompletionsTextAdapter` / `openaiChatCompletions` / `createOpenaiChatCompletions` factory — a sibling to the existing Responses adapter for callers who want the older `/v1/chat/completions` wire format against the OpenAI SDK.

  ## Decouple `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` from the OpenAI base

  OpenRouter ships its own SDK (`@openrouter/sdk`) with a camelCase shape, so inheriting from the OpenAI-shaped base forced a snake_case ↔ camelCase round-trip on every request and stream event. ai-openrouter now extends `BaseTextAdapter` directly and inlines its own stream processors (`OpenRouterTextAdapter` for chat-completions, `OpenRouterResponsesTextAdapter` for the Responses beta), reading OpenRouter's camelCase types natively. The `@tanstack/openai-base` and `openai` dependencies are removed from ai-openrouter; only `@openrouter/sdk`, `@tanstack/ai`, and `@tanstack/ai-utils` remain. The ~300 LOC of inbound/outbound shape converters (`toOpenRouterRequest`, `toChatCompletion`, `adaptOpenRouterStreamChunks`, `toSnakeResponseResult`, …) are gone. Internal: duck-typed `as { ... }` casts on stream chunks in `OpenRouterResponsesTextAdapter` are replaced with direct narrowing via the SDK's discriminated unions.

  Public OpenRouter API is unchanged: `openRouterText`, `openRouterResponsesText`, `createOpenRouterText`, `createOpenRouterResponsesText`, the OpenRouter tool factories, provider routing surface (`provider`, `models`, `plugins`, `variant`, `transforms`), app attribution headers (`httpReferer`, `appTitle`), `:variant` model suffixing, `RequestAbortedError` propagation, and the OpenRouter-specific structured-output null-preservation all behave the same.

  `ai-ollama` remains on `BaseTextAdapter` directly — its native API uses a different wire format from Chat Completions and was never on the shared base.

  ## Summarize subsystem

  Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenRouter previously each shipped a bespoke 200–300 LOC summarize adapter. They now construct a `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter` (formerly `ChatStreamWrapperAdapter`, renamed and exported from `@tanstack/ai/activities`) wrapping their own text adapter, matching the existing OpenAI/Grok pattern. Removes ~600 LOC of duplicated logic across the six providers and ensures behavioural parity.

  Bespoke `*SummarizeProviderOptions` interfaces (e.g. `OpenAISummarizeProviderOptions`, `AnthropicSummarizeProviderOptions`, `GeminiSummarizeProviderOptions`, `OllamaSummarizeProviderOptions`, `OpenRouterSummarizeProviderOptions`) are removed from the provider packages' public exports. Consumers who imported them should switch to inferring the type from the adapter (`InferTextProviderOptions<typeof adapter>`) or remove the explicit annotation (it'll be inferred from the adapter argument).

  `SummarizeAdapter` interface methods are now generic in `TProviderOptions`. `summarize` and `summarizeStream` previously took `SummarizationOptions` (defaulted, so `modelOptions` was effectively `Record<string, any>` regardless of the adapter's typed shape). They now take `SummarizationOptions<TProviderOptions>`. Source-compatible for callers that didn't specify the generic; type-tighter for implementers and downstream consumers. `SummarizationOptions`, `SummarizeAdapter`, `BaseSummarizeAdapter`, and `ChatStreamSummarizeAdapter` previously had a mixed `Record<string, any>` / `Record<string, unknown>` / `object` set of defaults for `TProviderOptions`; they now uniformly default to `Record<string, unknown>`.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- Internal refactor: every provider now delegates `getApiKeyFromEnv` / `generateId` / `transformNullsToUndefined` / `ModelMeta` helpers to the new `@tanstack/ai-utils` package. `ai-openai` and `ai-grok` additionally inherit OpenAI-compatible adapter base classes (Chat Completions / Responses text, image, summarize, transcription, TTS, video) from the new `@tanstack/openai-base` package; `ai-groq` keeps its own `BaseTextAdapter`-derived text adapter (Groq uses the `groq-sdk`, not the OpenAI SDK) but consumes `@tanstack/openai-base`'s schema converter and tool converters. The remaining providers (`ai-anthropic`, `ai-gemini`, `ai-ollama`, `ai-openrouter`, `ai-fal`, `ai-elevenlabs`) only consume `@tanstack/ai-utils` because they speak provider-native protocols, not OpenAI-compatible ones. No breaking changes — all public APIs remain identical. ([#409](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/409))

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(ai-grok): add audio and speech adapters for xAI ([#506](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/506))

  Add three new tree-shakeable adapters that wrap xAI's audio APIs:
  - `grokSpeech` / `createGrokSpeech` — text-to-speech via `POST /v1/tts`. Supports the 5 xAI voices (`eve`, `ara`, `rex`, `sal`, `leo`), MP3/WAV/PCM/μ-law/A-law codecs, and the `language`, `sample_rate`, `bit_rate`, `optimize_streaming_latency`, `text_normalization` provider options.
  - `grokTranscription` / `createGrokTranscription` — speech-to-text via `POST /v1/stt`. Passes through `language`, `diarize`, `multichannel`, `channels`, `audio_format`, and `sample_rate`; maps xAI's word-level timestamps to `TranscriptionResult.words`.
  - `grokRealtime` / `grokRealtimeToken` — Voice Agent (realtime) adapter for `wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime` with ephemeral tokens via `/v1/realtime/client_secrets`. Supports the `grok-voice-fast-1.0` and `grok-voice-think-fast-1.0` models.

  New model identifier exports: `GROK_TTS_MODELS`, `GROK_TRANSCRIPTION_MODELS`, `GROK_REALTIME_MODELS` and their corresponding types.

### Patch Changes

- Tighten `GeneratedImage` and `GeneratedAudio` to enforce exactly one of `url` or `b64Json` via a mutually-exclusive `GeneratedMediaSource` union. ([#463](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/463))

  Both types previously declared `url?` and `b64Json?` as independently optional, which allowed meaningless `{}` values and objects that set both fields. They now require exactly one:

  ```ts
  type GeneratedMediaSource =
    | { url: string; b64Json?: never }
    | { b64Json: string; url?: never }
  ```

  Existing read patterns like `img.url || \`data:image/png;base64,${img.b64Json}\``continue to work unchanged. The only runtime-visible change is that the`@tanstack/ai-openrouter`and`@tanstack/ai-fal`image adapters no longer populate`url`with a synthesized`data:image/png;base64,...`URI when the provider returns base64 — they return`{ b64Json }`only. Consumers that want a data URI should build it from`b64Json` at render time.

## 0.6.8

### Patch Changes

- Wire each adapter's text, summarize, image, speech, transcription, and video paths through the new `InternalLogger` from `@tanstack/ai/adapter-internals`: `logger.request(...)` before each SDK call, `logger.provider(...)` for every chunk received, and `logger.errors(...)` in catch blocks. Migrates all pre-existing ad-hoc `console.*` calls in adapter catch blocks (including the OpenAI and ElevenLabs realtime adapters) onto the structured logger. No adapter factory or config-shape changes. ([#467](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/467))

## 0.6.7

### Patch Changes

- Expose the `/tools` subpath and add an empty `supports.tools: []` channel per model so Grok adapters participate in the core tool-capability type gating. No provider-specific tool factories are exposed yet — define your own tools with `toolDefinition()` from `@tanstack/ai`. ([#466](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/466))

## 0.6.6

### Patch Changes

- Align stream output with `@tanstack/ai`'s AG-UI-compliant event shapes: emit `REASONING_*` events alongside `STEP_*`, thread `threadId`/`runId` through `RUN_STARTED`/`RUN_FINISHED`, and return flat `RunErrorEvent` shape. Cast raw events through an internal `asChunk` helper so they line up with the re-exported `@ag-ui/core` `EventType` enum. No changes to adapter factory signatures or config shapes.

### Minor Changes

- feat: Add AG-UI protocol events to streaming system ([#244](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/244))

  All text adapters now emit AG-UI protocol events only:
  - `RUN_STARTED` / `RUN_FINISHED` - Run lifecycle events
  - `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` / `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` / `TEXT_MESSAGE_END` - Text message streaming
  - `TOOL_CALL_START` / `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` / `TOOL_CALL_END` - Tool call streaming

  Only AG-UI event types are supported; previous legacy chunk formats (`content`, `tool_call`, `done`, etc.) are no longer accepted.
